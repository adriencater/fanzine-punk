			<h3>Death</h3>
			<p>The trio initially started as a funk group in Detroit, Michigan, in 1971, but quickly “pushed the group in a hard-rock direction that presaged punk”.</p>
			<p>In 1964, the three young Hackney brothers watched the Beatles’ first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The following day, David found a discarded guitar in an alley and used it to start learning to play.</p>

			<h3>Half Japanese</h3>
			<p>The band was formed in a bedroom in Michigan in 1975 by brothers Jad and David Fair. They decided to be rock stars one morning, bought instruments and recorded their first album that afternoon.</p>
			<p>Half Japanese’ original instrumentation included a small drum set, vocals, and an out-of-tune, distorted guitar. According to Jad, their songs can all be divided into either “love songs or monster songs.”</p>
			<p>Half Japanese were born under the banner of musical illiteracy: all members were “forbidden” from learning to play their own instrument.</p>

			<h3>The Stooges</h3>
			<p>The Stooges were an American rock band formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1967. Initially playing a raw, primitive style of rock and roll, the band gained a reputation for their confrontational performances.</p>
			<p>The Stooges' early musical experiments were more avant garde than punk rock, with Iggy Pop incorporating such household objects as a vacuum cleaner and a blender into an intense wall of feedback that one observer described as sounding like “an airplane was landing in the room.” Homemade instruments were also incorporated to flesh out the overall sound.</p>

			<h3>Minor Threat</h3>
			<p>Minor Threat was an American hardcore punk band, formed in 1980 in Washington, D.C.</p>
			<p>The band was relatively short-lived, disbanding after only three years together, but had a strong influence in the emerging American hardcore punk scene, both stylistically and in helping to further establish the “do it yourself” ethic for music distribution and concert promotion.</p>
